# cmk_check_unifi-controller

Local Check for check_mk to get information about unifi infrastructure from controller API

## Requirements 

* UniFi Controller Software (does not need run on the same server as the agent)
* Check_MK Agent (Tested on 1.5.0p24 / 1.6.0p12)

## Installation

### Test

Running the command on the unifi controller host should give you something like this:
```
FIXME
```

## Check_mk/OMD

Now you can refresh the services of your unifi controller host in the webUI of Check_Mk and you get the new services in your inventory.
